## ðŸŽ‰ Current Status: ALL TASKS COMPLETE âœ…

**Complete BSV Repository Prioritization System - Production Ready**

### âœ… Complete System Implementation
- **Tasks 1-5**: Full pipeline from data collection to final outputs
- **109 features** per repository with AI-powered ranking
- **Production-ready** with single-command execution
- **Investment-grade** deliverables ready for BSV team review

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
python3 setup_venv.py

# Activate environment  
source venv/bin/activate

# Add your GitHub token to .env file
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env file and add: GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

### 2. Run Complete Analysis
```bash
# Single command execution - complete pipeline
python run_analysis.py

# This will execute all 5 tasks:
# Task 1: Data Collection & Enrichment
# Task 2: Feature Engineering & Signals  
# Task 3: LLM Pairwise Ranking
# Task 4: Final Scoring & Evaluation
# Task 5: Output Generation
```

### 3. Review Results
```bash
# Check generated outputs
ls -la output/

# View final rankings
head output/bsv_prioritized_repositories.csv

# Read executive summary
cat output/executive_summary.md
```
