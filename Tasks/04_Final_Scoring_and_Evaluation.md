# Task 4: Final Scoring and Evaluation

## Objective
Combine all signals into a final ranking system with interpretable results and comprehensive evaluation.

## Input
- LLM pairwise rankings from Task 3
- Engineered features from Task 2
- Funding probability estimates from Task 1

## Key Activities

### 4.1 Composite Scoring Framework (Priority: High)
**Implementation**: Weighted linear combination
- **Score Components**:
  - LLM Preference Score: 60% (primary signal)
  - Technical Execution: 15% (velocity, releases, code quality)
  - Market Adoption: 15% (dependents, downloads, stars growth)
  - Team Resilience: 10% (bus factor, contributor diversity)
- **Funding Gate**: Multiply by max(0.6, 1 - p_institutional_funding)
- **Normalization**: Ensure final scores in [0,1] range

### 4.2 Explainability and Reasoning (Priority: High)
**Implementation**: Feature contribution analysis
- **Reason Codes**: Top 3 contributing factors per repository
- **SHAP Values**: Feature importance for individual predictions
- **Comparative Analysis**: Why repo A ranks higher than repo B
- **Human-Readable Explanations**: "High execution velocity, strong community, novel approach"

### 4.3 Comprehensive Evaluation (Priority: Medium)
**Implementation**: Multi-faceted validation approach
- **Ablation Studies**: 
  - LLM-only vs features-only vs combined rankings
  - Remove each signal component, measure rank correlation
- **Sanity Checks**: 
  - Manual review of top 10 repositories
  - Correlation analysis with intuitive metrics (stars, age)
  - Identify clear outliers and investigate
- **Stability Analysis**: Bootstrap ranking variance, identify stable top quartile

### 4.4 Bias Detection and Mitigation (Priority: Medium)
**Implementation**: Statistical bias analysis
- **Age Bias**: Correlation between final score and repository age
- **Popularity Bias**: Ensure weak correlation with star count (we're not ranking popularity)
- **Language Bias**: Check for programming language preferences
- **Size Bias**: Correlation with repository size metrics

### 4.5 Output Generation (Priority: High)
**Implementation**: Structured result presentation
- **CSV Output**: Ranked list with scores and reason codes
- **Summary Report**: Top insights, methodology summary, limitations
- **Visualization**: Score distributions, feature importance plots
- **Investment Briefs**: One-paragraph summaries for top 20 repositories

## Deliverables
- Final prioritized CSV with comprehensive scoring
- Evaluation report with ablations and bias analysis
- Executive summary with key findings
- Methodology documentation
- Investment brief summaries for top candidates

## Time Estimate
2-3 days

## Technical Requirements
- Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib/seaborn, shap, scipy
- Statistical analysis for correlations and significance testing
- Visualization tools for presenting results
- Report generation capabilities

## Success Criteria
- Final rankings that balance multiple signals appropriately
- Clear explanations for why each repository is ranked as it is
- Evidence that the system identifies genuinely innovative projects
- Low correlation with simple popularity metrics
- Stable rankings under bootstrap resampling
